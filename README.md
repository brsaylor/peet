# Python Experimental Economics Toolkit

PEET is UAA's application and programming framework for multi-player, networked economics experiments. Modeled roughly after Multistage from CalTech and UCLA, it provides a common set of services and user interfaces, such as parameter management, client-server communication, status monitoring, and output data management. Individual experiments can be implemented as Python modules that plug into the framework.

PEET version 1.0 includes the Island Experiment, described below.

PEET is free software released under the GPL v3 license.

## Requirements

PEET is written in the Python programming language, and uses the wxPython library for its graphical user interface, both of which must be installed in order to run the application.

- Python version 2.6: http://python.org/

- wxPython for Python 2.6: http://wxpython.org/


See the Basic Instructions for more details on installing the requirements and PEET itself.
